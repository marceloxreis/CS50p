## :label: **About CS50P**

**[CS50P]([https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python))**  is an online introductory course focused exclusively on programming with Python. It teaches foundational Python concepts such as functions, variables, conditionals, and loops, alongside practical programming skills like handling exceptions, writing unit tests, using third-party libraries, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming.

## :computer: **About the Repository**

An important part of the course, it's submitting the problem sets, as well as the final project for feedback. This repository contains the solutions I've come up with for the problem sets.

Also down below are links and short descriptions for each of the projects. If you'd like to read more about the implementation requirements, there's a link in each folder that will lead to them.

## :closed_book: **Academic Honesty**

Keep in mind the course's [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/). You should try figuring out a solution yourself before looking at other implementations. Also, bear in mind that I am a beginner, I've taken the course to learn, so the solutions might not be the best implementations.

- **[NUMB3RS](week%207/numb3rs)** - _One Python file validates if a string is a valid IPv4 address, checking format, digit content, range (0-255), and absence of leading zeros. A separate test file thoroughly verifies this validation logic with various correct and incorrect IPv4 address formats, including edge cases and expected error handling._

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

- **[Seasons of Love](week%208/seasons)** - _This project consists of two Python files: a main script and a test file. The main script calculates the total minutes lived since a user-provided birth date and converts this number into English words. It robustly handles date input and utilizes the inflect library for number-to-word conversion. The accompanying test file uses pytest to validate the core logic of calculating minutes lived and converting numbers to words, ensuring accuracy and proper formatting for various numerical inputs._

- **[Cookie Jar](week%208/jar)** - _This Python code defines a Jar class that simulates a cookie jar with a fixed capacity, allowing users to deposit and withdraw cookies. It enforces constraints such as non-negative integer values for capacity, deposits, and withdrawals, and prevents exceeding capacity or withdrawing more cookies than available. A separate pytest file thoroughly tests all functionalities of the Jar class, including initialization with valid and invalid capacities, string representation, and the deposit and withdrawal methods, ensuring they handle valid operations and raise ValueError for invalid ones._

- **[CS50 Shirtificate](week%208/shirtificate/shirtificate.py)** - _This Python script uses the FPDF library to generate a PDF "shirtificate" document. It creates a custom PDF class that includes a header with a "CS50 SHIRTIFICATE" title and an embedded "shirtificate.png" image. The script then prompts the user for a name and generates a PDF displaying "[Name] took CS50" on the shirt, saving the output as shirtificate.pdf._
