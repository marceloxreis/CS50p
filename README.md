## :label: **About CS50P**

**[CS50P]([https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python))**  is an online introductory course focused exclusively on programming with Python. It teaches foundational Python concepts such as functions, variables, conditionals, and loops, alongside practical programming skills like handling exceptions, writing unit tests, using third-party libraries, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming.

## :computer: **About the Repository**

An important part of the course, it's submitting the problem sets, as well as the final project for feedback. This repository contains the solutions I've come up with for the problem sets.

Also down below are links and short descriptions for each of the projects. If you'd like to read more about the implementation requirements, there's a link in each folder that will lead to them.

## :closed_book: **Academic Honesty**

Keep in mind the course's [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/). You should try figuring out a solution yourself before looking at other implementations. Also, bear in mind that I am a beginner, I've taken the course to learn, so the solutions might not be the best implementations.
